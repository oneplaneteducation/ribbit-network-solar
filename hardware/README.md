## Overview
This is the hardware respository that contains all the design files and documentation for the physical assembly of the Frog Sensor.

## Sensor Versions
There have been two major versions of the Frog Sensor to date:
* [Frog Sensor Version 1](v1) - This version was based on the Raspberry Pi and included an off-the-shelf enclosure
* [Frog Sensor Version 2](v2) - This version is based on a Beaglebone black and includes a fully 3D printed enclosure.

See each folder linked above for the relevant design files, CAD, and assembly instructions!

## Solar-powered Sensor Development
Prototyping is currently in progress to assess the possibility of taking the Frog Sensor off the grid. Check out the design progress [here](solar).
