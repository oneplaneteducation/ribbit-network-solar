## Introduction

In the future, it would be cool for the Frog Sensor to be solar-powered. This folder documents the progress towards making that a reality.

Due to supply-chain uncertainty and the potential for future changes to the Frog Sensor's architecture, initial development towards a solar-powered Frog is focused on developing a self-contained solar battery charging system designed to supply power to a either a Frog Sensor V1 (Raspberry Pi), a Frog Sensor V2 (Beaglebone Black), or any future version with a different processor.
