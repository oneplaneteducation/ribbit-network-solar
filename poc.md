# Proof of Concept

This document hopes to provide a record of early prototyping progress. As mentioned in the [readme](README.md), the initial goal is to develop a solar-charged battery system that can provide enough power to reliably operate the Frog Sensor.

## Electronics

The following assumptions were applied to the initial electronics design in order to reduce complexity:
- The battery will be a 2-cell series NiMH
- The solar panel will provide a regulated 5V supply
